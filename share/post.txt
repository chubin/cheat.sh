You can add a new entry to a cheat sheet or create a new cheat sheet
in one of the following ways:

1. With curl:

    cat ${cheatsheet} | curl -F 'newcmd=<-' cheat.sh
    curl --data-binary @${cheatsheet} cheat.sh/newcmd
    
   newcmd is the the name of the command you want to post
   (use your @twitter or email@ in the post).
    
2. With git:

~~~
    # clone chubin/cheat.sh
    git pull https://github.com/${you}/cheat.sh && cd cheat.sh
    cp ${cheatsheet} cheat.sheets/newcmd
    git add cheat.sheets/newcmd
    git commit -m '...' cheat.sheets/newcmd
    git push
    # send pull request 
~~~

3. With a browser:
    
    Go to the end of the cheat sheet, click the dollar sign with the mouse
    and post your cheat sheet. It will be saved automatically and reviewed.

When writing an entry for a cheat sheet, please keep in mind:

    1. We don't try to repeat manuals and documentation sites
    2. We don't try to document each and every special usage case of a tool
    3. We try to find and gather the most interesting usage cases
