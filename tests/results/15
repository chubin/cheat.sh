## 1. Primitive Datatypes and Operators

# You have numbers
3  # => 3

# Math is what you would expect
1 + 1   # => 2
8 - 1   # => 7
10 * 2  # => 20
35 / 5  # => 7.0

# Integer division rounds down for both positive and negative numbers.
5 // 3       # => 1
-5 // 3      # => -2
5.0 // 3.0   # => 1.0 # works on floats too
-5.0 // 3.0  # => -2.0

# The result of division is always a float
10.0 / 3  # => 3.3333333333333335

# Modulo operation
7 % 3   # => 1
# i % j have the same sign as j, unlike C
-7 % 3  # => 2

# Exponentiation (x**y, x to the yth power)
2**3  # => 8

# Enforce precedence with parentheses
1 + 3 * 2    # => 7
(1 + 3) * 2  # => 8

# Boolean values are primitives (Note: the capitalization)
True   # => True
False  # => False

# negate with not
not True   # => False
not False  # => True

# Boolean Operators
# Note "and" and "or" are case-sensitive
True and False  # => False
False or True   # => True

# True and False are actually 1 and 0 but with different keywords
True + True # => 2
True * 8    # => 8
False - 5   # => -5

# Comparison operators look at the numerical value of True and False
0 == False  # => True
1 == True   # => True
2 == True   # => False
-5 != False # => True

# Using boolean logical operators on ints casts them to booleans for evaluation, but their non-cast value is returned
# Don't mix up with bool(ints) and bitwise and/or (&,|)
bool(0)     # => False
bool(4)     # => True
bool(-6)    # => True
0 and 2     # => 0
-5 or 0     # => -5

# Equality is ==
1 == 1  # => True
2 == 1  # => False

# Inequality is !=
1 != 1  # => False
2 != 1  # => True

# More comparisons
1 < 10  # => True
1 > 10  # => False
2 <= 2  # => True
2 >= 2  # => True

# Seeing whether a value is in a range
1 < 2 and 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 and 3 < 2  # => False
# Chaining makes this look nicer
1 < 2 < 3  # => True
2 < 3 < 2  # => False

# (is vs. ==) is checks if two variables refer to the same object, but == checks
# if the objects pointed to have the same values.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point a at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b = a             # Point b at what a is pointing to
b is a            # => True, a and b refer to the same object
b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal
b = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # Point b at a new list, [1, 2, 3, 4]
b is a            # => False, a and b do not refer to the same object
b == a            # => True, a's and b's objects are equal

# Strings are created with " or '
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'

# Strings can be added too
"Hello " + "world!"  # => "Hello world!"
# String literals (but not variables) can be concatenated without using '+'
"Hello " "world!"    # => "Hello world!"

# A string can be treated like a list of characters
"Hello world!"[0]  # => 'H'

# You can find the length of a string
len("This is a string")  # => 16

# You can also format using f-strings or formatted string literals (in Python 3.6+)
name = "Reiko"
f"She said her name is {name}." # => "She said her name is Reiko"
# You can basically put any Python expression inside the braces and it will be output in the string.
f"{name} is {len(name)} characters long." # => "Reiko is 5 characters long."

# None is an object
None  # => None

# Don't use the equality "==" symbol to compare objects to None
# Use "is" instead. This checks for equality of object identity.
"etc" is None  # => False
None is None   # => True

# None, 0, and empty strings/lists/dicts/tuples all evaluate to False.
# All other values are True
bool(0)   # => False
bool("")  # => False
bool([])  # => False
bool({})  # => False
bool(())  # => False

# Access a list like you would any array

# Looking out of bounds is an IndexError
li[4]  # Raises an IndexError

# You can look at ranges with slice syntax.

# (It's a closed/open range for you mathy types.)
li[1:3]   # Return list from index 1 to 3 => [2, 4]

li[:3]    # Return list from beginning until index 3  => [1, 2, 4]
li[::2]   # Return list selecting every second entry => [1, 4]
li[::-1]  # Return list in reverse order => [3, 4, 2, 1]
# Use any combination of these to make advanced slices
# li[start:end:step]

# Make a one layer deep copy using slices
li2 = li[:]  # => li2 = [1, 2, 4, 3] but (li2 is li) will result in false.

# Remove arbitrary elements from a list with "del"

# Remove first occurrence of a value

li.remove(2)  # Raises a ValueError as 2 is not in the list

# Insert an element at a specific index
li.insert(1, 2)  # li is now [1, 2, 3] again

# Get the index of the first item found matching the argument
li.index(2)  # => 1
li.index(4)  # Raises a ValueError as 4 is not in the list

# You can add lists
# Note: values for li and for other_li are not modified.
li + other_li  # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Concatenate lists with "extend()"

# You can unpack tuples (or lists) into variables

# You can also do extended unpacking

## 6.1 Inheritance
####################################################

# Inheritance allows new child classes to be defined that inherit methods and
# variables from their parent class.

# Using the Human class defined above as the base or parent class, we can
# define a child class, Superhero, which inherits the class variables like
# "species", "name", and "age", as well as methods, like "sing" and "grunt"
# from the Human class, but can also have its own unique properties.

# To take advantage of modularization by file you could place the classes above in their own files,
# say, human.py

# To import functions from other files use the following format
# from "filename-without-extension" import "function-or-class"

from human import Human


# Specify the parent class(es) as parameters to the class definition
class Superhero(Human):

    # If the child class should inherit all of the parent's definitions without
    # any modifications, you can just use the "pass" keyword (and nothing else)
    # but in this case it is commented out to allow for a unique child class:
    # pass

    # Child classes can override their parents' attributes
    species = 'Superhuman'

    # Children automatically inherit their parent class's constructor including
    # its arguments, but can also define additional arguments or definitions
    # and override its methods such as the class constructor.
    # This constructor inherits the "name" argument from the "Human" class and
    # adds the "superpower" and "movie" arguments:
    def __init__(self, name, movie=False,

        self.fictional = True
        self.movie = movie
        # be aware of mutable default values, since defaults are shared
        self.superpowers = superpowers

        # The "super" function lets you access the parent class's methods
        # that are overridden by the child, in this case, the __init__ method.
        # This calls the parent class constructor:
        super().__init__(name)

    # override the sing method
    def sing(self):
        return 'Dun, dun, DUN!'

    # add an additional instance method
