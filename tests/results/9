#  How do I copy a file in python?
#  
#  shutil (http://docs.python.org/2/library/shutil.html) has many methods
#  you can use. One of which is:

from shutil import copyfile

copyfile(src, dst)

#  Copy the contents of the file named src to a file named dst. The
#  destination location must be writable; otherwise, an IOError exception
#  will be raised. If dst already exists, it will be replaced. Special
#  files such as character or block devices and pipes cannot be copied
#  with this function. src and dst are path names given as strings.
